              <h2>HONEY POT MECHANISM</h2>
              <p>
                  A honeypot is a security system that acts as a decoy to attract and deceive attackers, making them
                  believe they have found a vulnerable target. By engaging with this fake system, attackers
                  unknowingly expose their tactics, techniques, and tools, which are then monitored and recorded. This
                  data helps security teams analyze and understand attack strategies, allowing for enhanced threat
                  detection and response. Honeypots are valuable because they reduce the risk to actual systems while
                  providing insights into the latest cyberattacks, helping improve overall security defenses.

              <p>
                  Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers scalable cloud computing through Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute
                  Cloud), enabling users to deploy virtual servers. Users can choose from various instance types
                  tailored to specific workloads, such as general-purpose and memory-optimized. Key components include
                  Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Elastic Block Store (EBS) for storage, and security groups for traffic
                  management. AWS provides flexible deployment options like on-demand and reserved instances. Common
                  use cases include web hosting, application development, and big data processing.

              <p>
                  AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a managed service that protects web applications from threats
                  like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). It filters and monitors incoming HTTP and HTTPS
                  requests using customizable rules, allowing users to block malicious traffic while safeguarding
                  sensitive data. Key features include real-time monitoring, bot control, and integration with
                  services like Amazon CloudFront and Application Load Balancer. With logging and metrics available
                  through Amazon CloudWatch, AWS WAF provides valuable insights into attack patterns. By leveraging
                  this service, organizations can enhance security, reduce data breach risks, and maintain web
                  application performance without impacting user experience.

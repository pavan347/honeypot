      <h2>What is a Honeypot?</h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        A honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a decoy system to
        attract cyber attackers. It simulates a real system with potential
        vulnerabilities, luring attackers to interact with it. This helps in
        studying the attack patterns and understanding the methodologies used by
        malicious actors.

              A honeypot is deployed within the network, appearing as a
              vulnerable target to attackers.

            <p>
              The honeypot attracts attackers by mimicking a real system,
              capturing their actions in real-time.
